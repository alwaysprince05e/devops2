# DevOps Project
Hello, welcome to my DevOps project!

## GitHub Actions Workflow

To automate our DevOps process, we use GitHub Actions. Below is a basic workflow file to get started:

### 1. Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

Inside your repository, create a new file at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

### 2. Commit and Push

After adding the workflow file, commit and push the changes:

```sh
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions CI workflow"
git push origin main
```

Now, every time you push or open a pull request to the `main` branch, the workflow will automatically run.
